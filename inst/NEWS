For more details and all changes before May 2012 please see the (now discontinued) CHANGELOG in the source package (inst/ folder).

CHANGED BEHAVIOUR since Version 1.32:

Other Changes since Version 1.32:

* improved mzData writing, now includes MSn spectra and less verbose.
* improved netCDF writing, but not yet good enough for AMDIS


CHANGED BEHAVIOUR since Version 1.14:

* centWave may report a smaller set of peaks, due to a small bug
  in the ROI algorithm some features with mass deviation > ppm were retained.

Other Changes since Version 1.14:

* New method for grouping: an algorithm inspired by mzMine
  group(method="nearest") has been implemented. It is slower
  than group(method="density"). It can individually group
  close-eluting peaks of very similar mass

* New method for retention time correction:
  The retcor(method="obiwarp") algorithm operates on the raw data,
  and thus allows to correct runs without well-behaving
  peak groups, or without peak picking at all.

* fillPeaks(method="MSW") is now also available
  for direct infusion spectra. The findPeaks(method="MSW")
  now returns several intensities, and correctly reports
  mzmin and mzmax for peaks.

* centWave now uses dynamic memory allocation, needs much less memory,
  and these BUF related errors should be a thing of the past.

* centWave gains an optional argument "noise",
  which is useful for data that was centroided without any intensity threshold,
  centroids with intensity < "noise" are omitted from ROI detection

* the fillPeaks() methods now remember which was
  an observed, and which was a "filled" peak.

* For direct infusion spectra diffreport() now shows
  the raw peak shapes, and also indicated "real" and "filled" peaks.

* xcmsRaw can now filter for positive/negative spectra,
  if the file includes both polarities. xcmsSet() can pass
  the polarity to contain positive/negative peaks only.
